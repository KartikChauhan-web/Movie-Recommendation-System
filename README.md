# Movie-Recommendation-System
First, I performed data pre-processing to extract tags from a database containing info about movies such as genre, overview, cast etc. Then, I used scikit-learn class libraries to vectorize tags and found the cosine similarity between each movie. This helped me in recommending five movies to user based on a movie he/she likes.
